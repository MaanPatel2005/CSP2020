    <h1> The Turtle Spangled Banner <h1>

	In our project, the Turtle Spangled banner, we used a lot of turtle commands such as while loops, for loops, and maneuvers with the turtle. The flag is made up of 3 while loops. One while loop is for the short stripes, one while loop is for the long stripes, and one while loop is for the blue square in the corner. Followed by the flag, there is a while loop that prints 50 turtles onto the screen. The turtles are in an infinite while loop that move. The story behind the movement is very simple. When the vertical turtle moves and turns red, it indicates that the teacher is not very happy. The teacher turtles are the vertical turtles. The horizontal turtles are the students. When the teacher turns around and turns red, the student turtles pass a note. The notes position on the flag is symbolized by a yellow turtle. 
	The background of the flag is resembling the painting skills of an elementary schoolers. Donâ€™t you remember when you were in Elementary and you used to make small weeds in the ground and the sun had rays? Well, we decided that we wanted to kind of recreate that to resemble the beginning of our class and the age of the turtles in the flag. The students are passing a note behind a teacher which you would normally see in elementary school.  <h1>

    <h1> Pac-Maan Project  </h1>
    In our project, Pac-Maan, my team and I used a lot of define commands, loops, and if statements to maneuver turtles and make collisions. Early on, we wanted to make a PacMan game with the character going through the maze, however this would be extremely challenging to do so we decided to make a simpler version of the game. The turtles are stored im a list. Images are registered as turtles. We used while and for loops to give the turtle and ghosts a continuous motion. We used if statements to determine collisions and whether or not the game would end

    <h1> Flappy Bird Project  </h1>
	In our project, Flappy Bird, my group decided to split work amongst ourselves. 1 person was in charge of the pipe generation, the score system, the background, and the flapy bird mechanics. First, we generated a background. After this we added in the flappy bird. We then defined functiosn for the movement of the bird. Also, we used a gravity system to manipulate the bird around the screen. An animation was also added to make the bird look as if it were flapping its wings. In regards to the scoreboard, we decided to only have a textfile that contained the highest score instead of having an actual leaderboard. When you die, the top score is presented and your score too is presented. If you get the highest score, the highest score changes to your current score.
